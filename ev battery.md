Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing the transportation sector with their promise of zero-emission travel and sustainable energy usage. However, a key challenge for EV users and manufacturers alike is understanding and optimizing battery consumption â€” the most critical and expensive component of an EV.

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of EV battery consumption patterns. Using real or simulated time-series driving data, the goal is to uncover insights into how various factors such as speed, distance, elevation, acceleration, temperature, and power usage influence the rate of battery drain.

The findings from this analysis can help in:

Optimizing vehicle performance for better energy efficiency

Informing users about energy-draining driving behaviors

Assisting manufacturers and fleet operators in route and battery planning

Providing a foundation for further machine learning applications like range prediction or anomaly detection

Through interactive visualizations and feature analysis, this project aims to deepen our understanding of electric vehicle energy dynamics and set the stage for more intelligent battery management systems.
